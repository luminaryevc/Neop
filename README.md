This is our final project in our training camp.

The purpose of this project is to develop a computer vision-based solution for efficient parking management. The system utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to find and count empty parking spots, detect illegal parking, and read vehicle license plates for various purposes, including stolen vehicle identification and permit management.


##Idea:
Smart parking: Our project uses computer vision to support smart cities and a number of other sectors, by:
1- Prior to the arrival of the driver, identify the open parking places.
2- Differentiate between the right and wrongly parked cars.
3. Differentiating between legitimate and illegal vehicles.
4. Identification of the reported cars' drivers with a snapshot of the driver's face.


##aim:
With this project, we hope to assist in the development of smart cities, as well as provide assistance to the General Department of Traffic and other businesses that might benefit from the System.


##Features:
-Finding and Counting Available Parking Spaces: The system uses computer vision algorithms to examine parking lots and find parking spaces that are vacant. With the use of this information, vehicles can rapidly find open spots, reducing traffic, and maximising parking usage.
-Illegal Parking Detection: The technology identifies cars parked illegally or in prohibited zones by inspecting video feeds. It notifies parking attendants or authorities, enabling quick response to situations of unlawful parking.
-The project makes use of algorithms for licence plate recognition to read and understand vehicle licence plates. This capability has several uses.
   -Identification of Stolen automobiles: The technology compares licence plate data to a      
    database of stolen automobiles. If a match is discovered, an alarm is sent to the closest 
    police station for prompt action.
   -Permit Management: The system verifies whether a vehicle has a valid parking permit. If 
    a permit is detected, the barrier opens to allow entry. Vehicles without proper permits  
    are denied access.


##Benefits:
-Parking efficiency is increased because to the system's real-time information on available spaces, which also optimises parking space use and cuts down on time spent looking for a place. This results in better efficiency and client satisfaction.
-Enhanced Security: The technology contributes to greater security in parking spaces by identifying stolen vehicles and preventing unauthorised parking. The immediate police alarm notice enables speedy reaction and car retrieval.
-Streamlined permission Management: By automating permission verification, the system makes it easier for authorised vehicles to enter, decreasing the need for manual inspections and promoting more efficient operations.
